# to_old_reddit
chrome extension which redirects reddit.com to old.reddit.com

this was developed for personal use since i have an old low resources machine and the new reddit ui is too slow for me.

to use it:

1-clone the repo

2-navigate to chrome://extensions/

3-enable developer tools

4-press load unpacked and navigate to the cloned directory

(this has only been tested on linux so far but should work on any platform)
